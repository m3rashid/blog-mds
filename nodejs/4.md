## Benchmarking Nodejs and Golang Servers

In this test, I made two servers, one with node (express) and the other with golang (gin) and tested out their performance on handling requests. I used Apache bench for this and logged the results into a log file at the end. Let me give you a glimpse of the servers made to test out.

<br />

Make a directory named `nodejs` and `yarn init` inside it, this will spit out a `package.json` file which will contain all the dependencies of the app. Next create a folder to collect all the logs we are going to do afterwards. I made a folder named `express/logs` to store all the logs. Then I gave sufficient permissions to the log files to be able to store logs inside it (just a UNIX thing). Then I wrote a basis javascript file named `express.js` which will act as the server in our case.

```bash
mkdir nodejs && cd nodejs
yarn init -y && yarn add express
mkdir express && cd express && mkdir logs && cd logs
touch test1.log test2.log test3.log
chmod 775 test1.log test2.log test3.log
```

```js
// express.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

let hitCount = 0;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  hitCount += 1;

  const healthcheck = {
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    message: "OK",
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
  console.log("HIT:", hitCount, healthcheck);
  console.log();
  try {
    return res.status(200).json({message: "Hello World"});
  } catch (error) {
    healthcheck.message = error;
    return res.status(503).send();
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Running on port 3000"));
```


Pretty much everything goes the same in case of Golang. I created a folder `golang` and `go mod init` inside it. This will create a `go.mod` file to store all the dependencies and their versions for the project. A github.com remote url is given so as to be able to convert to a module and be able to store it on github (just in case). This will enable other people to be able to download our code as a module and use it in their codebases. Then as earlier, we created log files and gave them relevant UNIX permissions. Then I wrote a basis go file named `gin.go` which will act as the server in our case.

```bash
mkdir golang && cd golang
go mod init github.com/m3rashid/load-testing-golang
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
mkdir gin && cd gin && mkdir logs && cd logs
touch test1.log test2.log test3.log
chmod 775 test1.log test2.log test3.log
```

```go
// gin.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var startTime time.Time

func uptime() time.Duration {
	return time.Since(startTime)
}

func init() {
	startTime = time.Now()
}

type HealthCheck struct {
	uptime    string
	message   string
	timestamp string
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {

		healthCheck := HealthCheck{
			uptime:    uptime().String(),
			message:   "OK",
			timestamp: time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339),
		}

		fmt.Printf("HealthCheck: %+v", healthCheck)

		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
			"message": "Hello World",
		})
	})
	r.Run(":4000")
}
```

Since, golang is a compiled language, I compiled it to a binary by running `go build golang/gin.go`. At the end, I did three tests, and the load/concurrency goes as follows.

| test &nbsp; | Load(total req) &nbsp; | Concurrency (req/sec) &nbsp; |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
|  1   |     500         |        100            |
|  2   |    10000        |        500            |
|  3   |    100000       |        1000           |

Then I tested the servers, The results came as follows.

### Inference
In each of the cases above, Golang simply rocks in each of the parameters above. The main parameters of our concern are : <br /> 
➡ Failed Requests (Most important): Even in the test 1 category, Nodejs fails to deliver a good performance required for a server side application. <br />
➡ Number of bytes transferred (should be lesser as both the servers are sending the exact same thing) <br />
➡ Requests per second (determines the actual concurrency throughput): Should be maximum <br />
➡ Time per request (Golang has an edge here because it is compiled and nodejs (javascript) is interpreted): Should me minimum. Responses must be as quick as possible so as to provide a good user experience <br />
➡ Transfer rate (how much the server is capable of): Even if both the test is done on the same network and with same bandwidth, Golang provides faster delivery (not by a very high margin) <br />
➡ Waiting time (ms, Average time to wait before handling the request):Requests need to be fulfilled as quick as possible, waiting time must be less as a whole <br />
